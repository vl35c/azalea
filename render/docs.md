# Font

Font overrides pygame's own font class, extending it's functionality to be able to render and draw in 1 function call, increasing code neatness.

### PROPERTIES:
`font` - the font face that the class uses\
`window` - the global window that the program uses

### METHODS:
`render(self, text: str, antialias: bool, color: Color, str, tuple, pos: tuple[int, int]) -> pygame.Surface` - renders string onto the screen - overriding the builtin pygame font.render\

`str` - string passed into render to be displayed\
`antialias` - should the string be antialiased\
`color` - the color for the text to be rendered in - examples - `Color.BLACK`, `"black"`, `(255, 255, 255)`\
`pos` - the position on the window for the text to be rendered

---
`string_to_surface(self, text: str) -> pygame.Surface` - converts a string into a pygame.Surface\
\
`str` - the string to be converted into surface

---

---
`draw(self, stock_data)` - calls the functions to draw the graph\
\
`stock_data` - contains data about stocks, and current day

---
`draw_base(self)` - draws the background of the graph

---
`draw_data(self, stock_data)` - draws the candles on the graph\
\
`stock_data` - contains data about stocks, and current day

---
`handle_held(self, stock_data)` - called when the mouse is held on the graph, and calls functions to highlight and display pricing data for the selected period of time\
\
`stock_data` - contains data about stocks, and current day

---
`highlight_candle(self, start_position: int, end_position: int=-1)` - if end position is -1, highlights a single candle, otherwise highlights a range of candles\
\
`start_position` - leftmost candle to highlight\
`end_position` - rightmost candle to highlight

---
`hover(self, stock_data)` - if the mouse hovers over a candle this function highlights and displays the data for that candle\
\
`stock_data` - contains data about stocks, and current day

---
`map(min_value: int, max_value: int, min_y: int, max_y: int, value: int) -> int` - takes a graph and maps the bottom and top values to the pixel values on screen, then works out where the `value` pixel would be (lerp)\
\
`min_value` - minimum value on graph\
`max_value` - maximum value on graph\
`min_y` - lowest y value of graph\
`max_y` - highest y value of graph\
`value` - value to be mapped onto graph

### PROPERTIES
`_func` - function attached to the interactor\
`bg_color` - background color of the interactor\

# Renderer

The renderer is used to hold drawing functions that may not be called in the correct order, and draw them in the correct order at the end of the frame.

### PROPERTIES
`held_functions` - list of functions held by the renderer waiting to be called

### METHODS
`call(self)` - calls all of the waiting functions in order of their `z` value

`hold(self, func, z: int)` - holds a function and a `z` layer - which is the order the function is to be called\
\
`func` - the function to be called\
`z` - layer to call function - lower means called first
